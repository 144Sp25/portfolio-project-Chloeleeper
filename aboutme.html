  <p>Hello my name is Chloe Leeper. I have been doing art for as long as I can remember. It wasnt until high school I knew I wanted to take a more serious approach with art in my future. I am now at Northwest Missouri State University studying Digital Media-Visual imaging!</p>
  <p>My favorite types of mediums I like to work with include:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Paining</li>
    <li>Drawing</li>
    <li>Charcoal</li>
    <li>Photography</li>
    <li>Adobe</li>
  </ul>
